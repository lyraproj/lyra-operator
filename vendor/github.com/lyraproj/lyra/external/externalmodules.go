// This file contains imports of external plug-in modules so that they are retained in the
// go.mod file when running "go mod tidy". The external package should never be built
// or referenced.
//
// NOTE: This is a Q&D solution to get the current Makefile/go.mod combo functional without
// too much hassle. We should investigate other ways to get all plug-in binaries into a
// common place.
